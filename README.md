# MachineLearning_HW4
Pattern classification using SVM, Random Forest, and LDA

# Part 1 - SVM
Use the Sickit toolbox for pattern classification using the MNIST dataset. Test the classification without data dimensionality reduction and with data reduced using PCA (90% and 95% of eigenvalues retained)
Report the accuracy of these SVM classifications using a linear and RBF kernel. Also study the effect of C (0.1, 1, 10, 100) on accuracy

# Part 2 - Random Forest
Apply Sickitlearn Random Forest Algorithm to the MNIST dataset for pattern recognition. Try on the original data without data dimensionality reduction and on the data with reduced dimensionality using PDA (90% and 95% of eigenvalues retained) 

# Part 3 - LDA
Use Scikitlearn's LDA toolbox, classify the handwriting in the MNIST problem.
